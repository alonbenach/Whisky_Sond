### Classification of Scotch Whisky

#

##### Dataset Description

1. Binary Columns:

   - The dataset contains 68 binary columns representing different characteristics of the whisky. These binary columns likely encode whether a particular characteristic is present or absent.

2. Numeric Columns:

   - 'DIST': Number of times the whisky was distilled.
   - 'AGE': Age of the whisky in ints, presumably since a specific year.
   - 'SCORE': A numerical score associated with the whisky.
   - '%': This column represents a percentage value which isn't clear to me at the beginning of the analysis.

3. Categorical Columns:
   - Columns describing the origin of grains and distillery provide categorical information about the whisky's production process and source. These columns are broken down to binary variables in 9 additional columns.
